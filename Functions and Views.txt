INSTRUCTORS
"Able to see how each student does on each test in each course?" : 

"How the single section did on a test (A's, B's, etc. for a section)" : GetSectionLetterGradeStats(@inputTestId BIGINT, @sectionId BIGINT)
	JSON Object returned:  '{"NumberOfAs":"numOfAs", "NumberOfBs":"numOfBs", "NumberOfCs":"numOfCs", "NumberOfDs":"numOfDs", "NumberOfFs":"numOfFs"}

Extra: Get the test average as a percentage grade : GetSectionTestAverage(@inputSectionId BIGINT, @inputTestId BIGINT) (FUNCTION--Returns a JSON object)
	JSON Object returned : {"SectionAverage":"the test average for the section"}

"How all sections did on a test (A's, B's, etc. for all sections of a course)" : 
	NOTE: I would suggest just running the GetSectionLetterGradeStats() function multiple times,
	      using different section IDs each time.

STUDENTS
"Last test score" : 
	NOTE: May require a "time submitted" column on the StudentTestAssignment table...
"Previous test scores" : STUDENT_GetAllTestGrades(@inputStudentId BIGINT) (FUNCTION--Returns a JSON object)
	JSON Object returned: {"StudentTestGrades":["firstTestValue", "secondTestValue", etc.]}
